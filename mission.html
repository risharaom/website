          <div class="card-content">
            <p class="card-text">
              Today's youth are facing unprecedented global challenges – from climate change to social 
              inequality. At the same time, they have access to powerful technologies that can help address 
              these issues.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Many young people lack the technical skills, mentorship, 
              and community support needed to apply their passion for change through technology.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <strong>Our solution:</strong> Code4Cause bridges this gap by providing a supportive community,
              technical education, and meaningful projects that make a difference. We connect passionate
              youth with the tools, knowledge, and opportunities to create technology-based solutions for
              real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <strong>Program Overview: </strong>Our initiative empowers students to apply data science and machine learning to address real-world problems in their communities. Designed especially for youth, this program teaches the fundamentals of ethical technology while guiding students through every step of the data science pipeline.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <strong>Participants will...  </strong>Explore core data science concepts and their societal impact
                Learn to collect, clean, and interpret data relevant to local issues
                Analyze datasets using tools like Matplotlib and other industry techniques
                Build and evaluate basic predictive models
                Develop and structure their own research papers
                
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                To ensure that student work leads to tangible change, we present their findings to local city councils, advocating for actionable solutions based on the data. The strongest student research will also be selected for publication in a pre-college academic journal, giving participants both recognition and a platform for impact.

            <ul class="impact-list">
              <li>Engaged over 100 young people in developing technical skills for positive impact</li>
              <li>Completed 15 community-focused technology projects</li>
              <li>Partnered with 8 local environmental organizations</li>
              <li>Created 5 open-source tools for environmental monitoring and advocacy</li>
              <li>Hosted 20+ workshops on coding, data analysis, and digital advocacy</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text">
              Our work empowers young people to be not just consumers of technology, but creators who
              use their skills to make the world a better place. Through collaborative coding and data 
              projects, we're building a community of technically skilled change-makers.
